# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is my second projectin the Full-Time Software Engineering program at TripleTen. I built a minimal page for a coffe shop by using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.
Our goal was to practice the structure of a webpage, organizing styles with BEM and creating simple animations.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox for layout
- Positioning and layering
- BEM file structure
- A custom contact form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

* I want to make the layout full responsive for smaller screens (mobile/tablets)
* Improve spacing and typography scaling
* Add dark mode option in the future
